# Phishing Detection Dataset

This repository contains a dataset for enhancing phishing detection using AI. The dataset is organized in the `dataset` folder.

## A Novel Dataset

The dataset can be found in the `dataset` folder. It includes various files necessary for phishing detection analysis.

This repository features a meticulously curated dataset of over 20,000 labeled messages for phishing and spam detection.

It includes 19,712 annotated phishing emails collected and labeled for machine learning and large language model (LLM) research, featured in "A Novel Dataset and Comprehensive Analysis Using ML and LLMs."

Additionally, it incorporates the well-known SMS Spam Collection dataset with 5,573 labeled SMS messages (spam vs. ham).

This combined dataset supports robust experimentation in phishing detection, spam filtering, and model evaluation for both traditional ML and modern LLM approaches.
